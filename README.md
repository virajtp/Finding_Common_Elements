# Finding_Common_Elements
Finding Common elements in two linked lists

Develop a function that takes 2 linked lists as constant arguments, and returns a new linked list that
contains every number the two lists have in common. One or both of the input lists may be empty or
may contain numbers.

First, check whether each list has duplicate values. If any of the input lists contain a duplicate value, print an error message and return. For example, list {3, 5, 6, 7, 3} which has 2 copies of 3, is not allowed.

Example Output : 
Enter Number of nodes in List 1: 8   
Enter List 1 Data: 3 2 4 9 8 1 10 5    

Enter Number of nodes in List 2: 7    
Enter List 2 Data: 10 1 7 6 4 5 9    

Common Values: 1 4 5 9 10
